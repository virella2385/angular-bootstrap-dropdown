# Angular Bootstrap Dropdown
An AngularJS directive that integrates a bootstrap dropdown.

A programmer's perspective to integrate bootstrap's pretty dropdown into the angular framework. Granted, the other route would to just style a `<select>` control but I took the backend developer route. This is just the first version, so I'll probably improve this as I learn more. Any suggestions and/or constructive criticism are/is appreciated.

  
### Parameters:
- list: the list, array, collection you want to display
- v-title: the text you would like to show in the dropdown list
- v-onselect: the controller function you want to call when selecting an option.
